Thank you for downloading the Material Editor

If modifying or adding to the FBX list, simply just drop an FBX file into /programFiles/models/fbx/, to add a custom icon, drop a .png file into /programFiles/models/icons/, with the same name as the fbx, otherwise the default icon will be used.
For example objects to base uv mapped textures off, go to the /programFiles/models/examples/ folder.

On export, all exports land in the Default output folder, unless specified, which is done in the settings menu in the top left.
Online/Local Documentation on the program can be found in the Help menu.
