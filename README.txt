To add a new model to the program, go to MaterialEditor/programFiles/models/, and add your model to the fbx folder. If you want a custom icon, put that in the icons folder, with the same name as the FBX.

Example assets can be found in the directory MaterialEditor/Example Assets/.

On export, all exports land in the Default output folder, unless specified, which is done in the settings menu in the top left.
