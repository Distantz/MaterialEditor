TMTK Material Editor - Distantz (2020) - Indev

Thank you for downloading a branch of the Material Editor.

If modifying or adding to the FBX list, simply just drop an FBX file into /programFiles/models/fbx/, to add a custom icon, drop a .png file into /programFiles/models/icons/, with the same name as the fbx, otherwise the default icon will be used.
For example objects to base uv mapped textures off, go to the /programFiles/models/examples/ folder.

On export, all exports land in the Default output folder, unless specified, which is done in the settings menu in the top left.
Documentation on the program can be found in the Help menu.
